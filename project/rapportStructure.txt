#### 1. Introduction
- Problem overview: praline counting in cluttered scenes.
- Motivation & constraints (e.g., no pretraining, not enough original images).
- Our approach in a nutshell (dataset synthesis + YOLO-style counting model).

#### 2. Dataset & Preprocessing
- Description of original dataset:
  - Number of images, resolution, conditions, objects per image.
- EDA on original dataset:
  - Image examples.
  - Histogram of praline count per image.
  - Class imbalance (bar plot per class).
- Instance extraction:
  - Show a few cropped pralines.
  - Mention 583 cropped pralines across 13 classes.
  - visualize size distribution of pralines or object positioning per class? Could help model design choices. (praline size dont vary much dont single head is good enough)
- Synthetic dataset generation:
  - Explain how background and objects were combined.
  - Explain how you ensured class balance.
  - Show sample generated images.
  - Final dataset stats (images, label balance, resolution).


#### 3. Model Architecture
- Motivation for direct counting (not object detection).
- Description of YOLO-style architecture:
  - Include diagram or schematic of model.
- Explanation of output layer: `13 classes × 6 neurons`
- Input size, normalization, padding strategy if relevant. (a precésier plus tard)

#### 4. Training
- Data split (train/val). (80/20, ballec on as tellement de donné)
- Hyperparameters (batch size, epochs, learning rate, etc.)
- Loss function & why softmax per class is used.
- Optimizer & scheduler if used.
- Include training loss plot.


#### 5. Evaluation
- Description of F1-score metric.
- Evaluation process (on synthetic validation or original images?)
- Show:
  - F1 score per image and average.
  - Class-wise accuracy/confusion matrix.
  - Visual comparison of ground truth vs prediction on sample images.

#### 6. Inference on Original Images
- Description of final inference setup.
- Load final model.
- Parse original images & corresponding CSV ground truth.
- Predict and compare with real counts.
- Show per-image table: `image ID | GT counts | Predicted counts | F1`

#### 7. Results Summary
- Final F1 score on original dataset.
- Example success cases (model does great).
- Example failure cases (too cluttered, occlusions, etc.)
- Insights about how well model generalizes to real scenes.

#### 8. Discussion & Limitations
- What worked well (e.g., synthetic scene generation).
- What didn’t (e.g., failure on specific chocolate classes?).
- Limitations of training from scratch.
- Ideas for future work (e.g., more complex scene synthesis, weak supervision, semi-supervised learning).

#### 9. Appendix
- Model architecture code.
- Full training logs.
- List of dependencies.
- Any helper scripts or utilities.
- Journal de bord (dire ce quon as essayé et dans quelle ordre :
	- autoencoder (sans comprendre comment sa marche)
	- ultralytics yolo
	- classical ML
	- yolo v1 torch
	- yoco (custom head)
