    "To train our chocolate detection and counting model, we developed a synthetic dataset generator that creates realistic scenes by compositing high-quality, transparent PNG cutouts of pralines and clutter onto large photographic backgrounds. The generator is designed to mimic natural variations in object placement, orientation, scale, and density while ensuring dataset consistency and coverage across all 13 chocolate classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Directory Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The image assets are organized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "../chocolate_data/\n",
    "├── praline_clean/\n",
    "│   ├── <ChocolateClass>/        # 1000x1000 transparent PNGs per class\n",
    "│   ├── MiscObjects/             # 1000x1000 PNGs of clutter (non-chocolates)\n",

    "    └── val.csv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scene Generation Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "For each synthetic scene, the generator performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Background Selection**: A random high-resolution background (6000×4000 px) is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Misc Object Placement**:\n",
    "   - Randomly place 0–6 miscellaneous objects per image.\n",
    "   - Each object receives a random rotation (0–360°) and is scaled with ±20% jitter applied to base scale factors.\n",
    "   - Objects are not allowed to overlap but may touch. Up to 20 retry attempts are made to find valid positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Chocolate Placement**:\n",
    "   - Each of the 13 chocolate classes is assigned 0–5 instances per image based on a skewed probability distribution favoring 0 or 1.\n",
    "   - Each chocolate instance is rescaled (with class-specific base factors and jitter), rotated randomly, and placed while checking that overlaps do not exceed 20% with any existing chocolates (touching is allowed).\n",
    "   - At least one pair of chocolates (if more than two are present) is forced to touch to reflect realistic clutter.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Label Generation**:\n",
    "   - Labels are saved in CSV format compatible with YOLO count training, with each row representing a synthetic image and columns encoding the number of instances per class.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     id,Jelly White,Jelly Milk,...,Stracciatella\n",
    "     1000001,2,1,...,0\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Scene Saving**:\n",
    "   - The final composite image can optionally be resized using a configurable downscaling factor.\n",
    "   - Image and corresponding label are saved in the appropriate `train` or `val` directory, based on a configurable split ratio (default: 80/20).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance & Scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "- The generator uses multi-threading to parallelize image composition, utilizing `N-2` CPU cores to avoid overloading the system.\n",
    "- Progress is tracked using `tqdm` to provide live feedback.\n",
    "- The total number of generated scenes is configurable (default: 10,000), and all key parameters (e.g., scaling jitter, image size, split ratio) can be tuned easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Result\n",
    "Using the technique descibed previously we could generate between 1000 and 20k picture similar to the following.\n",

    "The **YOCO** model is a custom convolutional neural network designed to **predict per-class object counts** in high-resolution images containing chocolate pralines. It avoids doing object detection + instance counting by directly classifying the number of instances for each of the 13 classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The YOCO network processes an RGB image of shape `(3, 800, 1200)` and outputs a tensor of shape `(13, 6)`, where:\n",
    "- 13 is the number of chocolate classes\n",
    "- 6 is the number of count classes: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or more]`\n",
    "Each entry is a **logit vector** representing the likelihood of that count for a given class.\n",

We choose to downscale the image by 4 as it would make the smallest praline ~50 px across which was deemed sufficient to keep the small feature still visible.\n",

    "This encoding has multiple advantages:\n",
    "- It reflects the **discrete nature** of count prediction.\n",

    "  - `LeakyReLU(0.3)` in the head\n",

    "> The lower F1 scores observed for the *Jelly* series may be due to their **reflective surfaces**, which cause inconsistent appearances under lighting variation. We hypothesize that modifying the synthetic generator to include **color jittering or reflective noise simulation** could improve performance on these classes. We are not sure why Comptesse is also significantly worse than other chocolate (it's big white round chocolate.) an hypothesis is the difficulty to differentiate from the background.\n",

    "\n",
    "Visual comparison between predictions and ground truth on real images was performed manually. However, due to the counting-only nature of the model and absence of bounding boxes, typical detection visualizations (e.g., masks or heatmaps) are not applicable. The results confirmed that the model is **visually accurate** in object presence and counts, particularly on well-lit and non-reflective samples.\n"

    "### Development Log – What We Tried\n",
    "\n",
    "This project went through several phases of experimentation. Here's a chronological overview of the different approaches we explored, with some thoughts on each one:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Autoencoder**\n",
    "   Our first (slightly naïve) attempt was to use an autoencoder, without fully understanding how it might work in the context of object counting. The idea was to reconstruct the image and spot anomalies that might correspond to pralines. Unsurprisingly, this didn’t yield meaningful results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ultralytics YOLO**\n",
    "   We then tried something more out-of-the-box: **Ultralytics YOLO**, using a pretrained model fine-tuned on our data. While promising at first, we realised later on that it was not allowed due to requiring the Ultralytics package.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Classical Machine Learning**\n",
    "   We also explored traditional ML methods (like regressions, k-NN, and random forests) using handcrafted features from the images. As expected, without  feature extraction or spatial context and due to skill issue, the models struggled to generalize and offered only limited performance. We did find a stupid heuristic that almost reach the baseline but the real world usage of such a solution remain unclear.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **YOLOv1 Reimplementation in PyTorch**\n",
    "   To get a better grasp of the detection pipeline, we reimplemented **YOLOv1 from scratch in PyTorch**. This helped us understand how detection and classification interact, and gave us more control over the architecture and training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **YOCO – “You Only Count Once” (Custom Model)**\n",
    "   Building on our previous attempts, we designed our own architecture specifically for **multi-class counting without localization**. Our model, YOCO, features a custom prediction head that outputs, for each class, a distribution over 6 count bins (0 to 5+).\n",
    "   Although inspired by YOLO in principle (for the convolution part), this model was built entirely from scratch and tailored to our needs: high-resolution image input, accurate per-class counts, and no bounding boxes.\n"

    "# Bonus\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we competed for the ML challenge, we also came up with a simple solution for the classical challenge by doing simple statistics on the training label only.\n",
    "We made a script to find the \"universal\" answer that would yield the highest F1 score in O(1) time and thus managed to reach F1 of ~0.4 by always predictive 1 for the number of instance for the 13 class. Although of little practical use we found it original, funny and stupid enough to deserve a mention here."
